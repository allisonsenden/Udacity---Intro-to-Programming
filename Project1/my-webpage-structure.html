							<p>
								I grew up in Maple Grove, MN and moved to Medina, MN when I was in 6th grade. I'm now 23 years old and graduate 
								from the University of Missouri- Columbia with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I never imagined I would grow up and 
				  			want to learn to write code. As I continued to study in school and gain experience through internships, I realized that it is actually 
				  			a lot more interesting and useful than I originally thought. I started working at Optum in the IT world as a newly grad and found myself 
				  			really wanting to learn how to code. So here I am now, creating my own webpage with HTML code. I'm very excited to learn more, and 
				  			hopefully I can apply this knowledge to many more projects in the future.

						<p>
							I am extremely close to my two siblings and feel really fortunate on that front. We are all two years apart which 
							allows us to closely relate to one another. Now that we're older, we even get all our friends together to hang out! Another extremely 
							important individual in our family is our dog, Bella. She is quite the little diva, but has the heart of a lover. I may be biased, but 
							she's the best cuddle buddy you can find. She always brightens everyones day by making us laugh and showering us with endless kisses.

							Growing up, my entire family was naturally very competitve. Therefore, it's not too much of a surprise that I'm very into sports. My
							favorite sport would have to be hockey. My uncle played in college and we were able to go support him as children, so he got us intruiged
							from a young age. I started playing when I was in 6th grade. But nowadays, I'm just an avid Wild fan!
						<li class="interest-2">
							Another interest would be anything on the lake. Living in Minnesota has the perks of 10,000 (really more like 11,000) lakes. I love
							to be out on the boat, enjoying friends and water sports. This all includes water skiing, wakeboarding, kneeboarding, wake surfing, tubing,
							etc. You have to take advantage of the beautiful weather and lakes around you, when you get the chance! There's just something about 
							being on a lake that makes life seem a little less stressful.
